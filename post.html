                <p>Recovering from shoulder surgery with one arm in a sling, I was already feeling sidelined when a friend hit me with a concrete challenge: Can we visualize data from PeeringDB.com in a way that reveals how companies actually interconnect, without days of manual work?</p>
                <p>What started as a small “what-if” experiment using AI to explore that question quickly evolved into <a href="https://cloudinfrastructure.org">cloudinfrastructure.org</a>, a working solution that maps interconnection patterns across networks, facilities, and cloud on-ramps. This was not a thought exercise; it is a real example of using AI as a tool to move from constraint to a shipped solution in days, not months.</p>
                <p>For Product Managers, especially in cloud networking, this story is a blueprint for turning vague, complex infrastructure questions into concrete tools that your customers can actually use.</p>
                
                <h2>PeeringDB: Powerful, but Hard to Interrogate</h2>
                <p>If you work in networking, PeeringDB is already familiar. It is the community-driven registry of networks, facilities, Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), and private interconnection points: a shared source of truth for how the internet physically fits together.</p>
                <p>However, PeeringDB is optimized for record lookup, not for answering cross-cutting, strategic questions. It is a rich library with a limited card catalog: you can easily look up a single network or facility, but it is painful to ask questions like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Across these two specific networks, where do they privately interconnect?</li>
                    <li>Which facilities emerge as critical hubs for private, network-to-network connectivity?</li>
                    <li>How does a particular provider’s private interconnect footprint compare across regions?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A friend framed the problem very specifically: “Which data centers are the most critical hubs for private interconnection between networks X and Y?”</p>
                <p>Answering that with manual exports and spreadsheets would take days. With one arm immobilized, even that brute-force option was off the table, which turned into a forcing function to find a higher-leverage approach.</p>
