As a product leader, my passion is building the bridges that connect the world’s leading clouds. I specialize in simplifying the complexities of hybrid and multi-cloud networking, enabling businesses to operate with agility and security, no matter where their infrastructure lives.

At Equinix, I lead product management for our cloud interconnection services. I have a track record of delivering revenue-impacting products, from initial strategy to launch and beyond. This includes spearheading the development of foundational services like Equinix Fabric VPN Gateway and our automated Cloud Router, which are used by enterprises to securely link their assets across AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and OCI. My experience at both a major cloud provider and the world's global interconnection leader has given me a unique perspective on solving customer challenges from both sides of the network.

I thrive at the intersection of high-level business strategy and hands-on technical execution—whether that means shaping a multi-year product roadmap, diving deep into BGP routing and cloud-edge architectures, or driving a successful beta with key customers. I believe the most powerful infrastructure is the kind that feels intuitive. Through clear storytelling, robust documentation, and a relentless focus on automation, I work to make the sophisticated networking tools our customers rely on both powerful and approachable.
